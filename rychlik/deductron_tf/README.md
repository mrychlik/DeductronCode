# Tensorflow version 2 supported
The early versions of this code were written for Tensorflow v.1 and they can
be found on the web.

The current version is updated to work with Tensorflow v.2. However, we use
it in compatibility mode with v.1. In principle, one should be able to go
to v.1 quite easily by modifying the top of the script.
