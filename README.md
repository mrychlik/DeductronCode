# DeductronCode
Computer codes accompanying the paper "Deductron - A Recurrent Neural Network".
This is a minimalistic implementation. This code should not be used in
any "production" system.

To run several programs exercising the package functionality, all one
needs to do is run the script:

python3 run.py



# Pure Python Deductron implementation
In folder deductron one finds a pure Python implementation of the Deductron RNN.
The learning scheme is discrete state space optimization.
The particular optimization scheme is Metropolis-Hastings.


# Deductron implementation using Tensorflow
In folder deductron_tf there is a Python script implementing Deductron RNN
through Tensorflow. This folder has a single script.

The run of the script
